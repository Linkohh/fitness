# Fitness Workout Planner

This small web app allows you to build a custom workout plan from over 200 exercises. Open `index.html` in your browser to start creating your routine. Select an exercise, set the desired reps, sets, duration, rest period and intensity, then add it to your plan. Each exercise entry now also includes a short description and the main/secondary target muscles so you can quickly reference the purpose of every movement.
